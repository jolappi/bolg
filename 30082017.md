### Trip to budapest 30.08.2017

First diffuculty started on the plane. I found out that
dropbox on iOS doesnt allow to make copy of local file 
without network connection. Why oh why. Dropbox got me
of guard this time but on return trip im ready for whatever
it could throw at me.

Yet anothet one.
iPad does suck in offline mode. I cant access the fcking dropbox files
through adobe while im offline. So i wont be doing new character to dnd 
role playing game i play with my friends and band mates.

I think iOS11 might solve these problems but where the hll im going to
get iOS11beta  on my tablet in the middle of the air without network 
connection. Im screwed as always but how the hll you could one prepare for 
the situations like these.

Anyways im on my way to Hungary, Budapest. Dont know what to expect 
but at least it is my holiday. And yeah it is spa so im not going to be
bored to death as i luv saunas and bathing and swimming.
And the hotel is actually going to be between Buda and Pest in the island
in the middle of river. How cool is that.


I have always had this travel policy that i don't drink coffee when i
travel. This time, oh my my, it really backtracked on me and i had a
crushing headache till i got a class of cheap redwine. oh yeah this really
reminds me that i drink way too much coffee nowadays. I think im gdmn coffee 
addict. 

Not long for now till we land. Hour or so. and now were almost landing.
I hope that at least some of hungarians speak english.


and last but not for least
here are some lyrics to end this update.

White sky as far as i can see
Loud roar as loud as it can be
Something is crushing my head
Still not giving up till im dead

im not rich im not poor
i dont feel sorry anymore
i have will to fight
oppose the power
for evermore

The future might rough me up 
it could let me be
but if i stay tough
it doesnt matter what it will be

take a step with me
into another reality
ill take you
where there is equality

no restrictions
no boundaries
no grief or sorrow
step with me into tomorrow

no one's above another
we are all the same
sister or brother
and were never afraid


btw i really hate the ongoing unequality in the world as you can see
from my lyrics. There is enough resources and knowhow for everyone to be
equals without forced labor and such. We definitely could be real 
societies if we wanted. If those who have would share what they have. 
yey hippies here i come. Humans would not have survived if thousands
years ago we would been the same as now. We would have been extinct if
we would not share inside our tribes and take care of our children and
old people. In past we all were as one not like today that only few of us 
possess everything in the world and theyre not willing to share.
I really do hope that our monetary systems crash hard and we can finally
start living for everybody and not for the chosen few.
