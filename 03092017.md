### 03.09.2017 on our way back

Still almost 6 hours to be back home.
But this trip was awesome and the weather was the
best we could get. Only downside was that we walked too
much and i had pretty new shoes so it left my feet 
pretty blistered. But anyway this is great country 
with lots of history for many to see. 
Taxis drive quite fast here which i dont mind
cause its always great to get where youre going fast.
Next hours are going to be buing stuff and drinking
booze as we finish do so that travel time gets shorter
the more youre drunk.
I cant tell you much about this country as it is better
for you to come here and see it yourself.
But Budapest castle was fast and we could have spent
all day there to explore the sights.
And thats just the one place.
Also travelling with river boats was cool. Hot sun and breeze made it very cozy on the river. Renting a boat and going up and down the river would be excellent idea.
oh yea im going to put some pictures for you to see when
i get back home.
What else?
Remember this and youll be ok, if it takes long to find 
what youre looking for youre doing it wrong as we found out many times.
We were looking for shorts for me and went through a shopping centre for hours and didnt find any. But after 
we were leaving the city we found them in store at the 
metrostation were we first entered the city but went
straight to shopping centre. Im not saying it wasnt
nice to see the local shopping centre.

We met this cool hungarian guy on plane who likes metal
as do we. We gotta arrange a party for him once he comes
to Tampere as he's going to seinajoki as exchange student.

and again some lyrics 

Well fight till the end
Well stand on our own
Well be the ones who wont bend
In unity we have
